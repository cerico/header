								<h1>Behaviour Basics</h1>
							</div>
							<p class="featured-text">Lately I’m thinking about how to make content accessible to everyone, and how to design products that respect people’s time and emotions. I work to research, understand, and clearly define user needs, then plan and execute designs that support these needs. I’m known for my love of owls, but I’m also passionate about cats, coffee, and southern food.</p>

I’ve also done the UX and design for the admin and templates for our biggest release: a tool that allows our clients to create their own responsive video websites.

										<h3>Deputy Designer, SimpleBits</h3>
										<p class="big">
											One of the highlights of my career was working with Dan Cederholm as his deputy designer for 2 years. In that time Dribbble was just taking shape, and I was able to assist Dan in growing the site from a small community to the invaluable home for designers it is today. I also helped with a number of personal and professional projects in Dan’s capacity as community organizer, author, and freelance designer.

										<p class="big">
											This was my first job in web design; I landed an internship making Flash websites for business training seminars after working in the hotel industry for 2 years. Within 6 months I was offerred a full-time position as a web designer, designing both marketing and product websites for a variety of businesses in the real estate industry. This job is where I cut my teeth, transitioning from a Flash hobbyist to a Photoshop and XHTML pro.
